## Highlights:
<p>By clicking the link it will take to corresponding ecommerce webpage.</p>

## Tip:
<p>To avoid 'Product not found', try searching the basic model and then select the desired version of that model instead of searching it with it's specifications.</p>
<p>For Example: Instead of searching 'Apple iPhone X (Space Grey, 256GB)', search 'Apple iPhone X' .</p>

## Future Scope:
<p>Currently this program works only on two e-commerce sites. More websites can be added to it. If you have more ideas, I'm excited to view Pull Requests from your side!</p>
